## Solution : 

Query made - 

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`
```
When the buttons are clicked it is filtered by category:

To view all the products (both released and not released) , we include **Gifts' OR 1=1 --** so that it the condition evaluates to TRUE & displayed all the gifts.

The query looks like 

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1 --' AND released = 1`
```
